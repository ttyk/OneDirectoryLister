# One File Directory-Lister ( OFDL )
One file version of [ DirectoryLister ]( http://www.directorylister.com/ ).


## What is OFDL?
It is simply replacement for default index of your server.
OFDL has much more functionality over default "indexer". It can be easily a platform for your website.

## Why OFDL?
It is simple to setup and customize. You just drop file, change couple settings, write your own Markdown page (optional) and you good to go. No database and configuration bullshit.

## OFDL vs DL
1. OFDL is faster, MUCH faster. It has no dependencies, no external resources, no JS. 
* DL does 13 requests per page, while OFDL does only 1.
2. OFDL is one-file. 
* Who needs a fucking tons of files and multiple folders with themes like in DL, when you can customize everything in one file.
3. OFDL is ~~cancer~~ bootloader free. It is in vanila CSS, wich makes it much faster.
4. OFDL has Markdown "Git-Hub's Readme" style pages.
